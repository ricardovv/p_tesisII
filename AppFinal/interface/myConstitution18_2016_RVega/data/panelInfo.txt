Usually, legal texts (Constitutions, Laws, Contracts, etc) are written by specialist, with a structure, language and purposes that made the documents difficult to understand by  humans (Im not saying lawyers are not humans). This project is an initial prototype to visually explore the structure (chapters and articles), relationships (related articles and proportions) and relevant contents (issues) of the chilean Constitution of 1980. This document was written, voted and implemented during obscure days of Pinochet’s dictatorship in 70’ and 80’. For many reasons, this Constitution needs to be to be changed. But, How to change something when most of the people doesn’t know its contents?.
This project was motivated to help people in Chile to a better understanding of a such an important text, the Chilean Constitution, specially in times where Democracy, not just in Chile, needs to be improved with the participation of new voices. Information is power. 
This project was initiated as a thesis by Ricardo Vega at MFA Design & Technology, Parsons The New School for Design. The translation used from The Constitute Project, used for non-commercial usage.
