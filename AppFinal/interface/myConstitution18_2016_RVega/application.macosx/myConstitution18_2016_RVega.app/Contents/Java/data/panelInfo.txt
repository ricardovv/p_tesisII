I made this project motivated by the need to help people in Chile to a better understanding of a such an important text, the Chilean Constitution, specially in times where Democracy, not just in Chile, needs to be improved with the participation of new voices. 
This project was initiated as a thesis by Ricardo Vega at MFA Design & Technology, Parsons The New School for Design. The translation used from The Constitute Project, used for non-commercial usage. 
Melanie Crean, Ted Byfield, Marko Tandefelt, Loretta Wolozin, Catalina Cortazar, Patricio González Vivo, Yuanjin Zhao, and to all my MFA DT’14 classmates. All the people who believe in something more than money. Special thanks to my wife María José Ríos & my daughter Alicia Beatriz for their support and smiles. Dedicated to my mother and my father that still is there.
